-Textures
-Models
-More levels (How Many? (I'm thinking 6 to 9, with varying lengths. 
	-The last levels would be about 3-4 times larger than the first ones))

Brody: I believe level3 layout should be changed so that the first left route is the exit route as I believe the first route players will choose will be the correct one!!

-Implement Scripting (Vmachine has been added to project)
-Move Enemy AI into Finite State Machine
-Animations
-Particle Systems and/or rigid body physics????? 
	-If the particle system can just be particles falling from a source (like sparks from a broken light) then I think that would be easy
	-Rigid Body Physics would be easy to implement but I don't know how it would fit into the game.
-In-game menu and (instructions done?)
