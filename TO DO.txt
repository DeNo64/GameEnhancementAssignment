-[DONE] Textures
-[DONE] More levels (How Many? (I'm thinking 6 to 9, with varying lengths. 
-[DONE] Move Enemy AI into Finite State Machine (Done! Testing needs to be done)
-[DONE] In-game menu (DONE!)
-[DONE] Instructions (done?)

-Models (for Player, Enemies, Keys and some crates or something to stack around the game)
-Animations
-Implement Scripting (Vmachine has been set up ready for scripts)
-Particle Systems and/or rigid body physics?
	-If the particle system can just be particles falling from a source (like sparks from a broken light) then I think that would be easy
	-Rigid Body Physics would be easy to implement but I don't know how it would fit into the game.
